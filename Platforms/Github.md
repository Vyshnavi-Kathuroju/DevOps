# Getting Started with Github

Once you have a github account, 

1. Create a new repository
2. Add a README.md file
3. Create structure to the repo

## Github Website

It starts with creating a repository to store your code and project.

As I am exploring Github from a beginner's perspective, I started with Github website to create a respository, Add a README file and high level directories, all within the website itself.

1. Use `New` option on the dashboard to create a new respository
   
2. On the repository page, use `Add file` > `Create new file` to add README.md and `Commit changes`.
   - Github has an editor that will allow you to create and edit files on the website itself.
   - If you are new to Markdown Syntax and Styling, the editor will have an icon at the bottom right to the relevant github docs.
     
3. Create a high level structure for your repository.
   - This involves creating directories and files within.
   - Use `Add file` > `Create new file` > `directory_name\` to create a directory.
   - When you add a `\` to the the end of the filename, it will be treated as directory.

I have currently created four folders in my repo to for a high level structure. Everything was done within the Github website itself at this point. I did not have to setup or install anything on my local system. But I see that I have to use a lot of clicks to get the work done. This approach is not feasible for complex development work. After working for a couple of hours, this process seems tedious. As I know I have to repeat this process on a daily basis, I need a local setup to build my project going forward.

## Git Command Line

Now that the basic project structure is already created through Github Website, a local development environment is needed to work with it locally. 

Before anything else, the project that already exists on the remote repo needs to be copied locally. 
- _Using User Interface (UI)_. One option to download the ZIP file using Github Website or through Github Desktop.
- _Using Command Line Interface (CLI)_. A more interesting option and a developer way of doing this is to do a `git clone` using the Git CLI.
