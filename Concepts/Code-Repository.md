# What is a Code Repository ?

We generally refer to `Code Repository` or a `Source Code Repository` as primarly the place where you store your code and related files. The role of a Code Repository can be seen as starting with the central code storage and exapding from there.

### Stores your code and other development assets

Code Repository is generally a `cloud based platform` that hosts your code and related development assets, configuration files and documentation.

### Uses Version Control

Code Repository uses `Version Control` to manage and track the progress and history of your code and project. `Git` is the Version Control System embedded into the widely used Code Repositories including GitHub, Azure Repos, Bitbucket and others.

### Enables Collaboration and Code Quality

Development teams can work on a repository simultaneously without breaking the code and maintaining code quality. This is enabled through the concepts of `branching`, `pull requests`, `code reviews` and `merging`.

### Fundamental to CI/CD

Git operations are fundamental for enabling Continous Integration and Continous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. A `Pull Request` or `Completed Merge` often acts as a trigger to initiate the CI/CD pipeline.
