# What is an Artifact ?

An `Artifact` is any item produced during the project & development cycle. It could be source code, compiled code, packaged code, container images, configuration files or documentation.

Artifacts serve as crucial checkpoints during the development cycle. They represent _deliverables_ produced at various stages of development. An artifact from one phase of the project can be an input to the next phase. They help you mark the progress of the development. 

### Pipeline
They enable the automation of `CI/CD`, Continous Integration (CI) and Continous Delivery (CD).

### Storage
The artifacts are stored in an `Artifact Registry`.
