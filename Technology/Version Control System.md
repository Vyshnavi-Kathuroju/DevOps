# What is a Version Control System ?

A Version Control System (VCS) is at the core of a Source Code Repository. VCS enables us to manage and track the progress and history of our code and project. We generally learn about the VCS in the context of Git and Github. Git is specifically a Distributed Version Control System.

#### So there are other kinds of Version Control System ...

- Local Version Control System
- Centralized Version Control System
- Distributed Version Control System

### Local Version Control System

In a `Local Version Control System (LVCS)`, the code and its history is stored locally. There is only a single copy of the code. But if this copy or its versions are corrupted, you cannot recover the code.

### Centralized Version Control System

`Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)` has the code and its history stored on a shared server. The team can clone the code, make changes and push the code changes to this central repository. But if the code or its versions on the shared server are corrupted, you cannot recover the code.

### Distributed Version Control System

And finally the `Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)` is the VCS that designed for the large scale enterprise projects and allows the modern development teams to collaborate on the projects in real-time. DVCS enables each team member to have the clone of the entire project, work with it locally and push the changes to the remote code repository for review and merging.

Git is the most popular Distibuted Version Control System. Git powers Github and other widely used Code Repositories that hosts the most critical enterprise projects.
